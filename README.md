This project is a java based tool for training a Self Organizing Map based on single cell RNA-seq data which is then used to evaluate gene lists for the degree of cluster formation by the DBSCAN algorithm. 
The goal is to allow users to in silico screen transcriptional perturbation data to make more accurate predictions
